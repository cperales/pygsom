"""@package GSOM

This is an implementation of the growing self-organizing map.

Different possible approaches for the GSOM have been presented in the past
by various researchers. To make things clear, this implementation is based
on the one described in the work of:

Alahakoon, Damminda, S. Halgamuge, and Bala Srinivasan:
"Dynamic self-organizing maps with controlled growth for knowledge discovery."
Neural Networks, IEEE Transactions on 11.3 (2000): 601-614.

Sadly, this article is not as comprehensive as desirable. Therefore this
implementation should not be taken as a reference, but as a best-effort
version. Some details of the algorithm have been assembled based on the
work of Mengxue Cao et. al, who described their approach within their work:

"Growing Self-Organizing Map Approach for Semantic Acquisition Modeling
way within their work"

Refer to both papers for further details.

Additionally, this algorithm picks up some of the aspects proposed in the
work of:

Andreas NÃ¼rnberger and Marcin Detyniecki:

 database visualization and exploration"
